## Classes Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
The project follows a structured format with the following key files and directories:

- `src/main`: Contains the main application classes.
- `src/main/java`:
  - **Movies and Series Management**:
    - `Pelicula.java`: Represents a movie and its attributes.
    - `Serie.java`: Represents a TV series and its attributes.
    - `Titulo.java`: A parent class for `Pelicula` and `Serie` to share common attributes.
    - `Main.java`: The entry point for the application, which initiates the program execution.
    - `CalculadoraDeTiempo.java`: A utility class to calculate time-based data for movies and series.
    - `FiltroRecomendacion.java`: Provides functionality to filter movies and series based on user preferences.
    - `Puntuacion.java`: Manages the rating system for movies and series.

  - **Audio Management**:
    - `MainAudio.java`: The main class for managing audio-related content.
    - `Audio.java`: Represents a general audio item, serving as the base class for music and podcast.
    - `Musica.java`: Represents a music item with specific attributes for music-related content.
    - `Podcast.java`: Represents a podcast with episodes.
    - `Episodio.java`: Represents an individual episode within a podcast.
    - `Playlist.java`: Manages playlists that can include various audio items like music and podcasts.

  - **Purchase Management**:
    - `GestionCompras.java`: Manages the process of purchases within the system.
    - `Compra.java`: Represents an individual purchase made by a user.
  
  - **Utility Classes**:
    - `MainArrays.java`: Demonstrates the use of arrays in the system for managing lists.
    - `Listas.java`: Implements additional list management utilities for the system.
  
  - **Logger and Utilities**:
    - `LoggerBase.java`: Defines a base logging interface.
    - `LoggerBaseImpl.java`: Implements the logging interface to handle log operations for the project.

The compiled output files are generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Running the Project in IntelliJ IDEA

To run this project in IntelliJ IDEA:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use `git clone` or download the source code.
2. **Open IntelliJ IDEA**: Import the project as a Maven/Gradle project if needed.
3. **Build the Project**: Go to `Build > Build Project` or press `Ctrl + F9`.
4. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the relevant `Main.java` or `MainAudio.java` classes depending on the functionality you want to test, right-click, and select `Run` or use the green play button in the toolbar.
=======
### Main.java
The main class that integrates different modules like `CalculadoraDeTiempo`, `FiltroRecomendacion`, `Episodio`, and `Pelicula` to provide a complete application for managing media titles.

### MainAudio.java
This class integrates audio-related features, using `Playlist`, `Musica`, and `Podcast` to manage different types of audio content.

### Episodio.java
Represents a single episode of a series. It implements the `Puntuacion` interface and includes attributes like episode number and name.

### Pelicula.java
Represents a movie and extends from the `Titulo` class, inheriting common attributes while adding a specific attribute for the director.
>>>>>>> 3a9710ca0cca45b044b416be767863e382ec0420

### Serie.java
Represents a TV series and extends from the `Titulo` class. It includes attributes such as the number of seasons, episodes per season, and minutes per episode.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Dependencies are handled via **IntelliJ's build tools**, which might include Maven or Gradle. If your project includes external libraries, they should be added to the `lib` folder or managed via IntelliJâ€™s project settings.
=======
### Titulo.java
This is the parent class for both `Pelicula` and `Serie`, containing common attributes like title type, name, release date, and duration.

### CalculadoraDeTiempo.java
A utility class that calculates the total time for a list of titles, demonstrating the use of polymorphism by accepting different types of `Titulo`.

### FiltroRecomendacion.java
Filters media titles based on their ratings, recommending those with a score of 4 or higher.

### Puntuacion.java
An interface that defines the `getPuntuacion()` method, which is implemented by media titles to return their rating.

### Audio.java
This is the base class for managing audio content, with attributes like title, duration, author, and release date.

### Musica.java
Represents a music track and extends from the `Audio` class. This class inherits attributes from `Audio` while providing the potential to add additional music-specific properties.

### Podcast.java
Represents a podcast episode and extends from the `Audio` class. Like `Musica`, it inherits from `Audio` and allows for more specific functionality related to podcasts.

### Playlist.java
Manages a list of audio content, whether it's music or podcasts, allowing users to create and manage playlists.

## Usage
You can modify the `Main.java` or `MainAudio.java` classes to create and manage different media titles, including both visual media and audio content. Use the `FiltroRecomendacion`, `CalculadoraDeTiempo`, and `Playlist` classes to filter recommendations, calculate total time, or manage playlists.
